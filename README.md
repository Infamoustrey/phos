<p align="center">Church Service Presentation Software. Free, as it should be.</p>

Phos is an opensource alternative to software's like [Proclaim](https://proclaim.faithlife.com/)
or [ProPresenter](https://renewedvision.com/propresenter/).
It aims for almost complete feature parody with these softwares at no cost. Phos is maintained by
the community and aims to fill a need that many churches have wihtout placing additional
financial burden on churches.

## Introduction

Phos runs on [electron](https://electronjs.org/), and is designed with portability,
productivity and performance in mind. It should run on any supported electron platform
including Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

## OS Considerations

Linux was listed last in the above list but because it is an open source operating system and
therefore has no cost(a strong principle this project is motivated by), it shall take priority
on bugs, fixes, and patches.

## Contributing
